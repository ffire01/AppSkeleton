# AppSkeleton

This is a attempt for macOS app development in Swift to provide a app skeleton for my future app dev, with several goals:

* Minimal Cocoa app startup code without using compiler synthesized main function by @UIApplicationMain.
* Not using any storyboard and xib/nib files, all UI element is programmatically created.
* Not using any AutoLayout, all layout functions is implemented manually for efficiency purpose.
* This app contains a basic function to downlaod from web using async URLSession api.
